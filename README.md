# SceneClick

SceneClick is a data-driven YouTube travel thumbnail optimization service.

Instead of generating "aesthetic" thumbnails,
SceneClick improves existing thumbnails based on regression-based visual insights.

## Key Idea
- Diagnose visual problems in thumbnails using regression analysis
- Convert insights into prompt & image processing rules
- Validate improvement via probabilistic click simulation

## Data Check
Since the original data file is too large, we uploaded it to Google Drive.
